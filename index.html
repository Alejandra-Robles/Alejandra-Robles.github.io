        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Nurse PractitionerðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I have volunteered at hospitals observing people at the front desk answering calls, guiding patients on what they need to do and where they need to go. I have also watched lots of videos on what a nurse practitioner does on a daily basis.  I also have cousins who are nurses and have taken the time to ask them questions, demonstrate certain procedures, and some pros and cons. I have also asked them what are the next steps I should be taking to continue to be on the path to become a nurse practitioner. Some other things I have done is participate in community events that are offering health care advice and guidance to familiarize myself with the healthcare system as a whole.  <br><br>

        Some other things I have also done to gain experience and familiarize myself with this career is I have attended public community events and have taken the time to ask professionals what they reccomend me doing in regard to the schools I should be attending, the nursing programs they reccommend, certain things I should start familiarizing myself with. I have also done lots of research and have joined and attended career workshops in which experienced nurse practitioners attend and they are able to answer any question or concern that I may have. i have also taken advantage of the free internships that have been offered at the university I currently attend.  I attend the University Of California, Riverside which is located in Southern California and in the Eastside neighborhood of Riverside. <br><br>

        Lastly, I attended Poly High School that is also located in Riverside, California, specifically Southern California.  I have lived in Riverside, California my whole life.  I was born and raised in the Eastside part of Riverside.  Interestingly enough, I have lived in this house my whole life.  I have always been immensely interested in choosing a career in the medical field but have always been indecisive of what I want to pursue exactly.  There are numerous careers to choose from.  Some careers I have considered in the medical field are assistant anesthologist, registered nurse, pediatrician nurse, ultrasound technician, and even a travel nurse before I have children and to gain that beautiful experience of traveling and doing what I love. It has always been a dream of mine to pursue a career in the medical field but have always put to much thought in the cost of everything and the time it will take me but I have learned to take a step back and realize that financial help is always available and I am still young and there is no need to rush anything.  Everything will occur at its given time and whenever it is meant to be.  I am really excited to get my career started in whatever I decide to pursue.  The medical field is the field I have chosen because I love catering to others, caring for others, and provide assistance to those in need.  I love being there for people in times of hardships and assistance.  The medical field is a perfect example of what fullfills those needs.  Although the medical field is not the easiest, it is definitely rewarding to yourself and the community.
